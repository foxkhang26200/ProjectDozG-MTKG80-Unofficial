# What is ProjectDozG?
- ProjectDozG is a project that bring higher One UI version like 8.0, 8.5, etc... to old phone and unlock HighEnd/flagship feature for budget/midrange variant, still a small project that handle by Dai-doz.  
- Important, it based on the UN1CA & QuantumROM build system which allows automatic downloading/extraction of the firmware, applying the required patches and generating a flashable zip or product.img and system.img file package for the specified target device. Especially, its build system allows to automatically download/extract the firmware, apply the required patches and generates a flashable zip or product.img and system.img file package for the specified device.

# What is ProjectDozG-MTKG80-Unofficial (ProjectDozG Unofficial made by Fox Khang/Lucasz)?
- ProjectDozG-MTKG80-Unofficial, also called as ProjectDozG Unofficial "was" made by Fox Khang/Lucasz, this unofficial build by me that brings ProjectDozG to MTK G80 devices, with purpose that bring higher One UI version like 8.0, 8.5, etc... to old phone and unlock HighEnd/flagship feature for the MTK G80 family, it based on ProjectDozGROM-builder by Dai-doz that based on QuantumROM tools and some features based on many projects such as UN1CA, Legacy-UI, and AstroROM.
- Credit and thanks to Dai-doz and SN-Abdullah Al Noman for letting me fork this repository, editing some files/stuffs inside this repository in order to be reasonable with this unofficial build by me, and letting me do this unofficial build for the MTK G80 for free.

- Any form of contribution, suggestions, bug report or feature request for the project will be welcome.

# How to use this QuantumROM builder that based in this project:
#### 1. Fork the Repository.
Give a ⭐ star to the repository.
Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Run the Workflow.
Open your forked repository.
- Go to the Actions tab.
- Select QuantumROM Tools.
- Click Run workflow.

### 3. Set Your Device Model.
Update your device model in the STOCK_DEVICE_MODEL option.
- If your model is available in /QuantumROM/Device folder of this repository, the tool will work for your device.
- If your model is not present, set STOCK_DEVICE_MODEL to None.

### 4. Kernel BPF Version Option.
Set this option to True if your kernel BPF version is 5.4 (lower than 5.10).
- Otherwise, set it to False.

### 5. Set Target Device Information.
- Configure the following options:
- TARGET_DEVICE_MODEL
- The device model from which you want to port the ROM.
- TARGET_DEVICE_CSC
- The country/region code used to download the target device firmware.
- TARGET_DEVICE_IMEI
- Required to download the target device firmware from the Samsung server.
- Change the IMEI if you want to change the target device.

### 6. OUTPUT_FILESYSTEM (erofs / ext4 / f2fs).
My tool can build images in two formats:
- erofs
  - Recommended if your device partition size is small.
  - Saves storage space.
  - Your kernel must support EROFS.
- ext4
  - Use this if your kernel does not support EROFS.
  - The generated image will be larger in size.
- f2fs
  - Recommended if your device partition size is small. (Not better than EROFS)
  - Saves storage space.
  - Your kernel must support F2FS.

### 7. Compress IMG to XZ (True / False).
If set to True:
 - The generated image will be compressed to .xz format.
 - This reduces file size before uploading.

If set to False:
 - The image will remain in its original format without compression.
   
### 8. Add Git Credentials:
In your forked repository, go to:
-Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Click **New repository secret**, then create a new secret:
- Name:
  - GIT_TOKEN
  - Add git secret token and save.
  - You can search on YouTube for a guide on how to create a GitHub Personal Access Token.
  - If you do not add the `GIT_TOKEN`, the built ROM info and link will not be added to your repository's Release section. You will get link only in runner output.
